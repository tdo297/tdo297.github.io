### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    In Lab 8, part 3 was my favorite part because I was working on ANSI & ASCII Animation. I had a lot of trouble in this part but everything seemed to be great when I finished this exercise. As a result, my code can draw a lot of cool shapes and it runs in Terminal looking great.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 Part 1's Date Difference With Functions is also one of my favorites. Understanding knitting in real life and applying it to lines of code is really fun. When you watch someone knit, you may notice certain modest yet repeated activities. Repeat the steps in a pattern to make a lovely cable knit sweater.

* Lab 10

    The interesting Lab 10 Part 3 is my favorite part of this course. We practiced reading text from the keyboard. We practiced reading a whole line of text from the keyboard. We found out how to open and read a file line by line. And we understand how to save text to a file. How difficult can it be to make an image?
